## What

Simple script to archive the *Discover Weekly* playlist.

## How

It is a CLI script for now, might change it later. It caches the access token.

It doesn't add duplicate songs and it adds the new songs in the beginning.

## Why

Last week I found a couple of really nice songs in the weekly playlist,
but I forgot to save them. Now the are lost :(

This script should make sure I don't lose any more songs this way.
